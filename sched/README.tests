CAUTION : environment MUST be correctly set, i.e. required environment variables
such as ANDROID_BUILD_TOP MUST be defined.

To run tests, a phony target has been added to Android.mk. So you can invoke it like this:

  mm test-sched

from the project directory. It invokes the run-sched-tests script.
This test invokes the AllTests test suite but can easily be modified to add/remove test cases.
To do so, one only has to pass the fully qualified name of the test class 
he wishes to run to the junit runner.
