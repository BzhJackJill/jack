To run the tests a configuration file must be provided.

Make a copy of the template so that your settings are not committed.

It can be passed by setting the property tests.config (with -D) with the path to the file.

To be able to use jack-tests to run the tests, the configuration file 
must define following properties:
 * jack.home: it must point to the parent dir of Jack git project
 * runtime.location.<runtime environment name>: location of host android runtime environments

The follwing values are supported:
 * runtime.location.dalvik-fast-host
 * runtime.location.dalvik-jit
 * runtime.location.art-host

Indicate the location of the legacy java compiler with:
 * toolchain.prebuilt.legacy-java-compiler

In Eclipse: define a run configuration with -Dtests.config as a VM argument.
On the command line:
 * use run-jack-tests script with the config file path as first parameter, and the test suite to
run as the second parameter
 * use Ant tasks (e.g. jack-test) to run common sets of tests.
